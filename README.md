### Subnet Vision

The Subnet aims to deliver comprehensive insights into cryptocurrency fund flows and balance changes, presented in a user-friendly manner. It is designed to:

- **Provide Funds Flow and Balance Insights**: Offer detailed tracking and analysis of cryptocurrency movements and balances.
- **Detect Anomalies**: Identify suspicious activities and irregularities that may indicate fraud, scams, rug pulls, or money laundering.
- **Combat Financial Crimes**: Assist in the early detection and prevention of financial crimes, including money laundering, fraud, and other illicit activities within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

This subnet continues the legacy of the blockchain data insights subnet from the Bittensor ecosystem, but with a renewed direction and vision.

### Roadmap

- [x] **Migration from Bittensor**: Transition the subnet from the Bittensor ecosystem to a commune ai ecosystem.
- [ ] **Chain Chat Integration**: Integrate [Chain Chat](https://chat.chain-insights.ai/), a web application that allows users to interact with the subnet.
- [ ] **Multinetwork support**: Implementation of dynamic network weight allocation based on the real network usage.  
- [ ] **Network Integrations**: Ongoing Miner's developments of blockchain indexers and llm models for various blockchain networks.
  - [ ] **Ethereum Indexer**
  - [ ] **Bittensor Indexer**
  - [ ] **Commune AI Indexer**
  - [ ] **and many more**
  

### Overview

### Subnet Architecture Components

**1. Subnet Owner**:
   - **Role**: The subnet owner acts as the coordinator and facilitator of the network. They are responsible for the overall development and maintenance of the subnet, including critical infrastructure like Chain Chat, a web application that allows users to interact with the graph and LLM models developed by miners.
   - **Responsibilities**: The subnet owner ensures the alignment of the network with its vision and goals, supports collaboration among participants, and maintains the core infrastructure.

**2. Validators**:
   - **Role**: Validators are crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of the network. They provide essential APIs to miners and ensure that all transactions and validation processes meet the required standards.
   - **Responsibilities**: Validators support miners by enabling their participation in various network activities, such as Chain Chat, and play a key role in verifying miners output.

**3. Miners**:
   - **Role**: Miners are active contributors to the network, responsible for developing blockchain indexers, participating in validation mechanisms, and integrating new technologies into the subnet.
   - **Responsibilities**: Miners track fund flows, detect anomalies, and create new blockchain integrations within the main subnet. They also train and integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) and are responsible for marketing their contributions to increase network usage and influence their standing within the indexed blockchain network.

These components work together in a collaborative ecosystem, with each playing a vital role in the subnet's operation and evolution.

### New Collaborative Model: Decentralized Innovation

### How It Was in the Past

In the previous centralized development model, the subnet's structure was heavily controlled by the subnet owner:

**Subnet Owner**: The subnet owner had complete control over the network's development, managing everything from design to implementation and maintenance. All critical decisions were made solely by the owner, which meant that innovation was driven by a single perspective. This centralized control created a bottleneck, limiting the diversity of ideas and hindering the network's ability to grow and adapt to new challenges.

**Miners**: Miners played a passive role in this model. Their involvement was limited to executing tasks and running code provided by the subnet owner, with little opportunity for independent contribution or innovation. As a result, their influence on the network's evolution was minimal, and the potential for collaborative innovation was largely untapped.

This centralized approach restricted the flow of ideas and slowed the pace of innovation, as the network's progress depended entirely on the subnet owner's decisions and direction.

### How It Is Now: Decentralized Innovation

#### Miners: Empowered Innovators

Miners have transitioned from passive participants to key contributors in the network's development. They now actively engage in various aspects of the subnet:

1. **Blockchain Indexer Development**:
   - Miners are responsible for creating blockchain indexers, not only for existing networks but also for new ones. This role is crucial for tracking fund flows and balances, significantly enhancing the transparency and integrity of the network.

2. **Validation Contribution**:
   - Miners take an active role in implementing validation mechanisms, which strengthens the overall security and functionality of the subnet. This shared responsibility makes the network more robust and resilient.

3. **Chain Chat Integration**:
   - Miners integrate their blockchain implementations with Chain Chat, a web application similar to ChatGPT, created by the subnet owner. This integration allows users to interact with the models developed by miners, facilitating real-time data analysis and decision-making.

4. **Marketing & Promotion**:
   - Miners are tasked with marketing their integrations, which directly impacts the usage and success of their contributions. Effective marketing can increase the revenue miners earn from actual usage, influencing their network weight and providing a financial incentive for continuous innovation.

5. **Network Creation & Weight Allocation**:
   - Miners can establish new indexers for new blockchains, forming subnets within the main subnet. This fosters a competitive environment where miners contribute to validation mechanisms, driving innovation through sophisticated algorithms. Miners gain network weight based on their contributions, which encourages ongoing development.

6. **Model Training**:
   - Miners are responsible for training their Large Language Models (LLMs). They have the flexibility to choose the most suitable tools and approaches for their needs, whether using the default OpenAI integration or any other model they prefer.

#### A Collaborative Ecosystem

The subnet has evolved into a collaborative ecosystem where development is a shared responsibility among all participants:

- **Co-Creation of Code**: The subnet code is developed collaboratively, leveraging the diverse expertise of miners, validators, and the subnet owner. This collective approach leads to more robust and innovative solutions, with shared ownership of the network's success.

#### Roles & Responsibilities

1. **Miner**:
   - Miners develop intellectual property (IP) through their contributions, such as blockchain indexers, validation mechanisms, and LLM models. They play an active role in the subnet’s validation processes, create new networks, and have the autonomy to integrate their own LLM models, using any tools or platforms they prefer.

2. **Subnet Owner**:
   - The subnet owner coordinates the overall development of the subnet, ensuring it aligns with the network’s vision and goals. They also maintain Chain Chat, the web application that facilitates interaction with the models developed by miners, and act as a facilitator to support miners and validators.

3. **Validators**:
   - Validators provide essential APIs to miners, enabling their participation in Chain Chat and other network activities. They play a crucial role in maintaining the network's integrity by ensuring that all transactions and validations meet the required standards, and they support miners in integrating their contributions seamlessly into the network.

This decentralized, collaborative approach fosters a dynamic and innovative environment, where all participants actively contribute to the network's evolution and success.
